# 🧠 IntelliCare AI

Welcome to **IntelliCare AI**!  
This project demonstrates my ability to build a **full-stack AI-powered healthcare application** that delivers intelligent medical consultations using modern web technologies, machine learning, and natural language processing.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**IntelliCare AI** showcases my ability to:

- Build a **full-stack AI application** using React and FastAPI  
- Integrate **AI-driven medical chat** using NLP and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Design a **scalable backend architecture** to serve AI-powered responses  
- Create a **responsive and user-friendly UI** for healthcare applications  
- Apply **real-world AI concepts** in a production-style web application  

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **AI-Powered Medical Chat**  
  Enables users to interact with an intelligent assistant that provides contextual medical responses.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  Enhances AI responses by retrieving relevant medical information using vector search.

- **Modern & Responsive UI**  
  Clean, responsive interface designed for seamless user interaction across devices.

- **Scalable Backend Services**  
  Modular backend services connect AI logic, document retrieval, and frontend requests efficiently.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### **Frontend**
- React 18 + TypeScript  
- Vite  
- Tailwind CSS  
- shadcn/ui  
- React Router DOM  
- React Query  

### **Backend & AI**
- FastAPI + Uvicorn  
- Python  
- NLP Libraries: spaCy, NLTK  
- FAISS (Vector Database for RAG)  
- Sentence Transformers (Text Embeddings)

## 📁 Project Structure

The project follows a **modular and maintainable structure**:

- Separate **frontend** and **backend** directories  
- Dedicated services for **AI chat** and **document retrieval**  
- Organized medical knowledge base for RAG  
- Clear separation of **UI, APIs, and AI logic**  

This structure ensures scalability and easier future enhancements.

---

## 🔄 Application Workflow

- User submits a medical query from the frontend  
- Backend processes the query using NLP and RAG  
- Relevant medical context is retrieved from the knowledge base  
- AI generates an informed response  
- Response is returned and displayed in the UI  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

- Expanded medical knowledge base  
- Improved AI response accuracy and explainability  
- User personalization features  
- Advanced analytics and insights
