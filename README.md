🧠 IntelliCare AI

Welcome to IntelliCare AI!
This project demonstrates my ability to build a full-stack AI-powered healthcare application that delivers intelligent medical consultations using modern web technologies, machine learning, and natural language processing.


🚀 Project Overview

IntelliCare AI showcases my ability to:
	•	Build a full-stack AI application using React and FastAPI
	•	Integrate AI-driven medical chat using NLP and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
	•	Design a scalable backend to serve ML-powered responses
	•	Create a clean, responsive, and user-friendly healthcare interface
	•	Apply real-world AI concepts in a production-style web application


✨ Key Features
	•	AI-Powered Medical Chat
Users can interact with an intelligent medical assistant that provides contextual responses based on medical knowledge.
	•	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Medical documents are indexed using vector embeddings to retrieve relevant context and enhance AI responses.
	•	Modern & Responsive UI
A clean, responsive frontend designed for smooth interaction across devices.
	•	Scalable Backend Architecture
Backend services expose REST APIs that connect AI logic, document retrieval, and frontend requests efficiently.


🛠️ Technologies Used

Frontend
	•	React 18 + TypeScript
	•	Vite
	•	Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
	•	React Router DOM
	•	React Query

Backend & AI
	•	FastAPI + Uvicorn
	•	Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
	•	NLP: spaCy, NLTK
	•	FAISS (Vector Search for RAG)
	•	Sentence Transformers (Embeddings)


📁 Project Structure

The project follows a modular and maintainable structure:
	•	Separate frontend and backend folders
	•	Dedicated services for AI chat and document retrieval
	•	Organized medical knowledge base for RAG
	•	Clean separation of UI, APIs, and AI logic

This structure supports scalability and future enhancements.


🔮 Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
	•	Enhanced medical knowledge base
	•	Improved AI response explainability
	•	User personalization
	•	Advanced analytics and insights
